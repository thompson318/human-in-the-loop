You've reached my website for human in the loop simulation. I'm interested in work that 
expands our knowledge of how humans may interact with novel technologies. This is 
especially relevant to my past research in interventional healthcare, where 
multi disciplinary teams of humans will interact with new technology to create 
patient benefit. But I'm interested in if and how this approach could be relevant to 
other research domains. I'm in the process of applying for funding to support research 
software engineering in this field. So if you're interested in collaborating on it please 
get in touch.
