# Human in the loop simulation for novel technologies in healthcare (and beyond).

I'm seeking expressions of interest in a novel idea to support translational research 
in interventional healthcare (and beyond). I'm targeting interventional healthcare because 
that is my research background, but if you have an idea for how my idea could be applied to
your research outside this domain I would also like to hear from you. 
There is also an [open component](#Open-Component:-Games-for-outreach-and-teaching) that 
may be applicable if your project doesn't fit neatly elsewhere.
I expect my idea to be applicable to projects that:

 - are translational, aiming for first in human trials within the next 5 years.
 - are developing novel hardware or software intended to be used by a human (either directly 
by the patient or by a clinician) to perform an intervention.
 - the technology works in collaboration with the user to produce an outcome.

To help with inspiration here are some examples I can think of from may past research, 
but this list is not meant to be exhaustive or restrictive; adding autonomy to surgical robotics,
 novel imaging devices (multi-spectral, photoacoustics, confocal microscopy), 
augmented reality displays, image mosaicking, things involving artificial intelligence. 
If you're working on a 
project that you think fits the description please [contact me](email:s.thompson@ucl.ac.uk)
to discuss.

# What I'm offering.

I'm in the process of applying for UKRI funding to provide research software engineering 
over five years to develop abstract simulations of novel technology that allow us to 
estimate the impact of system performance parameters on clinical out comes. We would:

 - work with you to identify key system parameters, modes of user interaction, and expected clinical outcomes.
 - provide around 3 months of research software engineering time to develop a relevant simulation.
 - support with performing a user study and publishing the results, similar to my [previous work](#Related-Publications) in the area.
 - ongoing support over the life of your translation project for small modifications to the simulation to test development ideas.
 - a final review (and publication) at the end of the project to see from
[UCL's Advanced Research Computing Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/)  how my simulations impacted the translation project. 

# What I need.

I am preparing a funding application to support this work. Having a set of candidate projects 
together with short letters of support from researchers would greatly enhance the application. So
if interested please get in touch by mid November.
