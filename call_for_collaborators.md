## Human in the loop simulation for novel technologies in healthcare (and beyond).

I'm seeking expressions of interest in a novel idea to support translational research 
in interventional healthcare (and beyond). I'm targeting interventional healthcare because 
that is my research background, but if you have an idea for how my idea could be applied to
your research outside this domain I would also like to hear from you. 
There is also an [open component](#Open Component: Games for outreach and teaching) that 
may be applicable if your project doesn't fit neatly elsewhere.
I expect my idea to be applicable to projects that:

 - is translational, aiming for first in human trials within the next 5 years.
 - is developing novel hardware or software intended to be used by a human (either directly 
by the patient or by a clinician) to perform an intervention.
 - the technology works in collaboration with the user to produce an outcome.

To help with inspiration here are some examples I can think of from may past research, 
but this list is not meant to be exhaustive or restrictive; adding autonomy to surgical robotics,
 novel imaging devices (multi-spectral, photoacoustics, confocal microscopy), 
augmented reality displays, things involving artificial intelligence.
