## Human in the loop simulation for novel technologies in healthcare (and beyond).

I'm seeking expressions of interest in a novel idea to support translational research 
in interventional healthcare (and beyond). I'm targeting interventional healthcare because 
that is my research background, but if you have an idea for how my idea could be applied to
your research outside this domain I would also like to hear from you. I expect my idea to be 
applicable to projects that:

 - is translational, aiming for first in human trials within the next 5 years.
 - is developing novel hardware or software intended to be used by a human (either directly 
by the patient or by a clinician) to perform an intervention.
 - introduce a collaration between the new technology and the user.

Some examples I can think of from may past research, but not meant to be exhaustive: adding automony to surgical robotics, novel imaging devices (multi-spectral imaging, photoacoustics, confolcal microscopy), augmented reality displays.
